# clipboard-capture

Simple utility for Windows for saving screenshots to your desktop automatically. 
Most programs out there don't work with the win+shift+s shortcut because they rely on capturing key presses instead of monitoring the clipboard. 
This utility uses native Windows APIs to get notified every time the clipboard is changed, so it's very fast and low on resource use.
